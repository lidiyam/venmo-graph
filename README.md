# venmo-graph

Analyzing venmo dataset of transactions:

- Use Venmo payments that stream in to build a graph of users and their relationship with one another.

- Calculate the median degree of a vertex in a graph and update this each time a new Venmo payment appears. The median degree is calculated across a 60-second sliding window.

Dataset and project details can be found in this [InsightDataScience repo](https://github.com/InsightDataScience/coding-challenge).
